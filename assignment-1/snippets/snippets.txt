About Us
Welcome to Local Asian Bistro, where you will find the best selected Pan Asian dishes in the cozy and chic Oriental-décor atmosphere. Our Thai recipes have been passed down from generation to generation within the family and brought us the childhood foodie memory. We like to see our customers to have a delightful dining experience at our bistro just like what we made at home. Not only Pad Thai that we are famous for but also other Pan Asian plates i.e. Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and Laotian are the signatures from each cuisine that inspires us to put it on the menu for the local community to taste it. And, that is why we are here to serve you the finest Pan Asian flavors you wouldn’t find it elsewhere. Just come dine with us at Local Asian Bistro "where Locals meet and eat".
