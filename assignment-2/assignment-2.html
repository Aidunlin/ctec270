                        <h1>Web Design Contest 2023</h1>
                        <h2>Official Contest Rules</h2>
                        <p>The Contest opens for entries on May 1, 2023 and closes August 1, 2023 (referred to herein as the Contest Live Period). Entries must be received by 11:59 pm EDT on July 1, 2023.</p>
                        <p>The contest rules will be made available on May 1, 2023 at 12:00 AM.</p>
                        <h2>Judging</h2>
                        <p>To select the Grand Prize and Category winners, and to determine the Top 50 entries overall, The Make Believe Media Group will recruit a minimum of 13 judges from its editorial board of readers. The judging panel also will be open to one representative from each Primary Sponsor. The judges are prohibited from entering the contest themselves or evaluating entries from any organization at which they are employed. All decisions of the judges will be final.</p>
                        <h2>Voting</h2>
                        <p>Most Popular Entries will be decided by the voting of registered users of the contest Web site. Voting will be open until September 11, 2020 (11:59 pm EDT). These votes will have no bearing on the selection of Grand Prize or Category winners, or the Top 100 Entries. Each registrant is allowed one vote per entry. Votes will not count if the registrant does not accurately complete the required fields on the registration form or if the registrant attempts to enter fraudulent data. The Contest Administrators will adjust the vote counts at any point in the competition to discount votes from registrants who have not registered properly or who attempt to vote for a single entry multiple times (including any attempt to use e-mail aliases). Voter registration data will be kept in strict confidence and used only for verification, to ensure a fair voting process.</p>
                        <p>Winners will be announced during a live Webcast on November 10, 2022 at 11:00 am EST.</p>
