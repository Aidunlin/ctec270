      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Aidan Linerud and I'm a student at Clark College located
        in Vancouver, Washington. I'm currently enrolled in the Web Development program and will graduate in 2024.

        I have taken several courses at Clark or at another school that I
        really enjoyed. Here are my favorite three:

        <li>Independent Tech Lab (CHS)</li>
        <li>AP Computer Science A (CHS)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        There are several things that I like to do outside of school. Some of
        these include:
